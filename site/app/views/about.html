		<p class="dark">October 2012 marked the launch of a global effort to enable free and open sharing of metabolomics data. Coordinated by EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute, COSMOS (Coordination of Standards in Metabolomics) has brought together European metabolomics data providers to set and promote community standards.</p>
		<p class="light">As part of WP5 MetabolomeXchange.org was setup. The initial release was early June 2014 and the formal introduction was during the 2014 Metabolomics conference later that month. MetabolomeXchange.org delivers the mechanisms needed for disseminating the metabolomics data that are being shared within the COSMOS consortium to the metabolomics community at large (both metabolomics researchers and databases). The main objective is to make it easier for metabolomics researchers to become aware of newly released, publicly available, metabolomics datasets that may be useful for their research.</p>

			At this moment MetabolomeXchange aggregates data from {{providers.length}} different data providers which all have agreed to share their data according to the rules as described in the <a target="_blank" href="/site/mx_collaborative_agreement.txt">consortium agreement</a>. If you want your data to become available in MetabolomeXchange there are two options. The preferred (and easiest) option is to submit your data to one of the existing data reposities connected to MetabolomeXchange (<span ng-repeat="provider in providers | orderBy:'name'"><a target="_blank" href="{{provider.url}}">{{provider.name}}</a><span ng-show=" ! $last ">, </span></span>). The other (less easy) option is to become a data provider. How to become a data provider is described in the <a target="_blank" href="/site/mx_collaborative_agreement.txt">consortium agreement</a>.
